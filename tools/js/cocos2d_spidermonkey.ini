# It is a good idea to add classes that you don't want to have a proxy object. Usually internal classes,

# Rules used to rename methods
# options:
#   name:"js_name"         Rename methods.
#   ignore                 This method will be ignored.
#   callback               This method is a callback. It will be invoked from Objective-C
#   optional_args_since:2  It means that all arguments starting from the 2nd argument are optionals
#   variadic_2_array       It means that all arguments are variadic, and an Array will be created with them
